# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The presentation mode feature enables users to remotely control presentations on a connected device using simple left and right navigation controls. This feature mimics the KDE Connect presentation remote functionality, allowing users to navigate through slides in presentation software by sending directional commands through the existing socket connection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want to access a presentation remote control interface from the home screen, so that I can navigate to the presentation control functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Presentation remote" tile on the home screen THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated presentation mode screen
2. WHEN the presentation mode screen loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface with left and right navigation controls
3. IF the socket connection is not established THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want to send "left" navigation commands to the connected device, so that I can go to the previous slide in my presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the left navigation button THEN the system SHALL send a "left" text message through the socket connection
2. WHEN the left button is pressed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the action
3. IF the socket connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent the action

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want to send "right" navigation commands to the connected device, so that I can advance to the next slide in my presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the right navigation button THEN the system SHALL send a "right" text message through the socket connection
2. WHEN the right button is pressed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the action
3. IF the socket connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent the action

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want a clean and intuitive interface similar to KDE Connect, so that I can easily control my presentation without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the presentation mode screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show two prominent buttons for left and right navigation
2. WHEN the screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators (icons and/or text) for left and right actions
3. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for button presses
4. WHEN the screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the connected device information in the app bar

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate back to the home screen from presentation mode, so that I can access other features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the back button or uses system navigation THEN the system SHALL return to the home screen
2. WHEN navigating back THEN the system SHALL maintain the socket connection for other features
3. WHEN leaving presentation mode THEN the system SHALL not disrupt the existing socket connection
