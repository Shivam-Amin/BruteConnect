#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags a single finger on the screen THEN the system SHALL send cursor movement commands with deltaX and deltaY values

1. WHEN the user taps the screen with two fingers simultaneously THEN the system SHALL send a right click command
2. WHEN the two-finger tap is registered THEN the system SHALL provide brief visual feedback
3. IF the socket connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to scroll vertically by dragging two fingers up or down, so that I can scroll through content on the remote device.
